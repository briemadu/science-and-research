# Guidelines

Here are the detailed guidelines for this seminar. Please read them carefully
and let me know if anything is not clear.

The seminar will then be based on three pillars:

- Presentation
- Participation
- Programming project

On our first meeting on April 12, I will introduce and motivate the topic in a
live session and we'll get to know each other.

Then, in the following weeks, you'll have a reading/watch list to work through.
As of the (probably) fourth week, one item in this reading list is a
presentation made by one of your colleagues.

We'll meet on Mondays for a short wrap-up of the previous content and for you
to work in small groups to discuss a worksheet. I will randomly assign you to
different breakout rooms each week, so that you have the chance to work with
different peers.

## Presentation

Each of you will be assigned one subtopic from the main topics in the schedule.
If you have a very strong preference for one topic, let me know, otherwise I
will randomly assign you a topic by April 19. I'll also point you to the
corresponding initial bibliography that you should expand during your research.

You must present this subtopic to your colleagues either in a 20-minute video
or in a 3,500-word blogpost (it's an approximately 15-minute read in
[Medium.com's](https://blog.medium.com/read-time-and-you-bc2048ab620c)
estimates, plus the needed time for non-textual content). Longer
videos/blogposts are fine, shorter are not.

Independent of the media you choose, assume that your audience is willing
that you spoon-feed them with whatever they need to understand that subtopic.
Be creative and produce content that will be interesting and informative.
A good layout and aesthetics is mandatory in both cases. The style may be more
informal and pedagogical; you can use pictures, memes, emojis, etc. Make sure
to include many examples to help comprehension.

Send me your presentation by the previous Monday, 20:00. So, if a topic will
be discussed on May 17, you must send me if by May 10 at 20:00, so that your
colleagues have enough time to work on that.

A detailed schedule will be posted on Moodle with your names and dates.

## Participation

Participation involves:

- working through the reading/watch list of each week
- filling in the documentation form on Moodle
- joining and contributing to the group discussions
- writing discussion minutes
- submitting individual worksheet solutions

The worksheets will be mostly composed of argumentative exercises
(no programming). The answers will not be graded but a submission will be
considered valid if, and only if, your solutions are coherent and complete. Any
mistakes will be discussed in the wrap-up.

Remember that participating in group discussions, completing the weekly tasks
and the valid submission of worksheets are a prerequisite to pass the course.
A minimum of 70% is necessary for each of them.

**Documentation**

Each week, after working through the suggested material, you must 
fill in a reaction form about the reading list and provide feedback 
about that week's presentation. Be polite and provide constructive
feedback. I will then gather the feedbacks, anonymise them and share with the
presenter. There will be a link on Moodle for submitting the documentation.


**Minute**

During the group discussions, you must use the opportunity to expose your
arguments and listen to the ideas of others. Do not write your answers to the
worksheet while discussing, concentrate instead on brainstorming. You will
work on your answers later, individually.

To help take notes, each group must nominate one person to write a minute of
the discussion and share with the others right after the meeting. This must be
submitted on Moodle right after the meeting, one per group. Put the name of the
members and the name of the person who wrote it. You must write a minute at
least once during the semester.



## Routine

### Checklist

Notice that we'll have a fixed checklist of tasks every week.

**Anytime until Sunday 11:59 p.m.**
1. work through the material in the reading/watch list, taking personal notes
2. read/watch the week's presentation
3. fill in the documentation form
4. be prepared to discuss the covered topics

**During the group discussion (Monday at 10 a.m.)**
1. discuss the worksheet with your colleagues
2. one member writes a minute of the discussion

**After the group discussion**
1. submit the minute (pdf, one per group) whithin 24 hours
2. write down your answers to the worksheet individually
3. submit your answers (pdf) until the next Sunday at 11:59 p.m.

Each of these tasks will have a corresponding submission link on Moodle.

# Programming project
**Reproducibility Challenge** (To be confirmed)

Your task in the final project will be replicating one paper, i.e.,
writing your own code to try to reproduce the results of a published paper.
I'll provide a list of papers for you to choose from. You will work on this task
and write a report about your findings in the format of a short paper.

Guidelines about the format, length, etc will be posted on Moodle.

There will be a link on Moodle for you to submit a zip-file with your code and paper.

**Submission deadline for the final project: September 30, 2021, 23:59.**

# Integrity

* Any material you hand in must be your own. I will not grade work that contains
plagiarism. If you are using external sources, [cite them properly](https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/citingsources).
Still, do not copy text, use them only to support your arguments.
* Help creating a nice environment for everyone: be polite, respect different
opinions and help each other. Any kind of harassment is forbidden -
contact me if you face any problem.
* The material on Moodle is private and only accessible to participants of the
course, so that every participant feels safe to expose their thoughts.
Due to data protection, you are not allowed to share anything from Moodle anywhere.
